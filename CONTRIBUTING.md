# Contributing to wrapido

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project is a plain Node/TypeScript CLI with no PHP or WordPress
install required to work on it - everything runs against a local fixture HTTP server or, if you want to,
a real WordPress site.

## Getting started

```sh
npm install
```

Run the CLI straight from source with `tsx` - no build step needed while iterating:

```sh
npm run wrapido -- <namespace> <route> [<verb>] [<id>] [--flag=value...] --url=<site>

# e.g.
npm run wrapido -- wp/v2 posts list --url=https://example.com --per_page=5
```

If you want a real built binary instead:

```sh
npm run build     # bundles to dist/cli.js via tsup
npm run dev        # tsup --watch
```

## Before submitting a pull request

Run the full local check suite:

```sh
npm test              # vitest: unit tests (via wp-scripts) + the execa-driven integration suite
npm run lint          # wp-scripts lint-js (WordPress/Gutenberg coding standards)
npm run lint:md:docs  # wp-scripts lint-md-docs (lints this repo's Markdown docs)
npm run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
npm run format        # wp-scripts format
```

Run a single test file or a single test by name while iterating:

```sh
npx vitest run --project unit formatter.test.ts                       # unit
npx vitest run --project unit -t "name substring"                     # unit

npx vitest run test/integration/cli-core.test.ts                      # integration (one file)
npx vitest run -t "name substring"                                    # integration
```

## Coding standards

This project follows WordPress/Gutenberg JavaScript coding standards. `eslint.config.js` and
`.prettierrc.cjs` are built on `@wordpress/eslint-plugin` and `@wordpress/prettier-config`
respectively (via `@wordpress/scripts`), so `npm run lint`/`npm run format` enforce the same rules
as Gutenberg itself — including required JSDoc on functions. Don't hand-roll ESLint/Prettier config
changes that diverge from those packages' defaults; add a narrowly-scoped override in
`eslint.config.js` instead, with a comment explaining why (see the existing `no-console` override
for `src/cli.ts`/`src/core/debug.ts` as an example).

## How the test suites work

- **Unit tests** (`test/unit/`), run under **Vitest** (the `unit` project), exercise pure logic - command/route parsing,
  formatting, indexer route matching - with no network involved.
- **Integration tests** (`test/integration/cli-core.test.ts`, `cli-core-routing.test.ts`,
  `cli-meta.test.ts`, `cli-auth.test.ts`, `cli-auth-oauth2.test.ts` - split across files, balanced by
  profiled time rather than line count, so Vitest can run them in parallel), run under **Vitest**, are
  the source of truth
  for end-to-end CLI behavior. Each file spawns its own plain `node:http` fixture server
  (`test/integration/fixtures/server.ts`) that models a `wp/v2` index, a `widgets` collection with full
  CRUD + `meta`, and a parameterized-only route, then drives the actual *built* CLI binary (`dist/cli.js`)
  against it via `test/integration/fixtures/run-cli.ts`'s shared `runCli` helper (`npm run
  test:integration` builds it automatically via a `pretest:integration` hook - a direct `vitest run`
  needs a prior `npm run build`). **No live WordPress site is needed** to run or write these tests, and
  none should be required to add new ones - when adding a new verb or command, prefer extending the
  fixture and adding an integration test over mocking `fetch` at the unit level, since most of the value
  here is in the URL-building and dispatch logic across the whole pipeline. Expect these tests to
  take seconds rather than milliseconds.

## Coverage

`npm run coverage` runs both suites and produces a merged coverage report under `coverage/`
(`coverage-summary.json`, `lcov.info`) plus updates the coverage badges at the top of this repo's
`README.md`. It deliberately doesn't just run each suite's own `--coverage` flag and combine the
results - an AST-based and a V8-based tool's instrumentation build incompatible statement/branch/function
maps for the same file, so merging them at that level produces misleading numbers. Instead both suites
write raw V8 coverage profiles into a shared `coverage/tmp` directory (via `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`), and a
single `c8 report` pass converts the combined raw data into one report. See `CLAUDE.md`'s testing
conventions section for the full mechanism if you need to change it. CI only commits the regenerated
badge on pushes to `main`, not on pull requests.

## Architecture

Before making non-trivial changes, please read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) in the repo root - it's the
canonical source of truth on how the codebase is organized (command grammar/dispatch, the discovery →
indexer → introspect → verbs → formatter pipeline, `meta` command mapping, help rendering, and testing
conventions), and keeping it up to date is part of any architectural change.

## Branches and pull requests

- Pull requests target `main`.
- Keep PRs focused on a single change; unrelated cleanups are easier to review separately.
- Make sure `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run lint:md:docs`, and `npm run typecheck` all pass before
  requesting review.
- If your change affects behavior or architecture, update `CLAUDE.md` and/or `README.md` alongside the
  code change, not as a follow-up.

## Reporting bugs and requesting features

Please use the issue templates - they ask for the details (command run, expected vs. actual behavior,
CLI/Node/OS versions) that make bugs reproducible.

Security issues should **not** be filed as public issues - see [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).
