# Agent mode

`wrapido` pairs well with AI agents (Claude Code, Codex, scripts): once auth is set up, an agent can discover a site's REST API and build content with it. **Agent mode** makes the output easy for a program to read, and changes nothing for people at a terminal.

## Turn it on

Detected automatically from your environment — no setup needed inside:

-   Claude Code (`CLAUDECODE`)
-   OpenAI Codex (`CODEX_CI`, `CODEX_SANDBOX`, `CODEX_THREAD_ID`)
-   GitHub Copilot's agent tooling (`COPILOT_AGENT`, `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL`)
-   Cline (`CLINE_ACTIVE`)
-   Cursor's agent/CLI terminal (`CURSOR_AGENT`)
-   Any tool following the cross-tool `AI_AGENT` convention

Not detected (e.g. a custom script, or a tool not listed above)? Set it by hand:

```sh
export WRAPIDO_AGENT=1
```

`WRAPIDO_AGENT` always overrides detection: `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` forces agent mode off (the escape hatch for a human working inside one of these tools' terminals), anything else non-falsy forces it on. `AI_AGENT` behaves the same way one level down — an explicit falsy `AI_AGENT` (e.g. `AI_AGENT=false`) also forces agent mode off, even if a more specific marker like `CLAUDECODE` is set.

Run with `--debug` to confirm: it prints `agent mode: on (CLAUDECODE)` or `agent mode: off`.

Note: VS Code's Copilot agent mode is reported to set no distinguishing environment variable (by design, to keep the agent's environment identical to a human's), so it may not be detected; use `WRAPIDO_AGENT=1` there.

| Errors                 | `Error: ...` text                                                                              | JSON on stderr, for every error (including a bad `--format`): `{"error":{"message","code","status","params","hint"}}`         |
| Unknown `--name=value` | Silently sent to the API                                                                       | Warning on stderr, with a suggestion (`--per-page` → `--per_page`)                                                            |

JSON is the default because it is the only format that is lossless for every command's output (nested objects, single items, schemas, errors). For a long, flat list, `--format=csv --fields=...` is roughly half the size; and `--fields` trimming matters far more than the format.

Data always goes to stdout and notices to stderr, so `2>/dev/null` gives clean data.

Paging (`less`/`$PAGER`) never engages under agent mode or when stdout isn't a real terminal — including every `execa`/subprocess invocation, piped output, and CI — regardless of `--no-pager`/config file settings, so scripted consumption of any `--format` is never affected.

## Works in any mode

These help agents but are available to everyone:

-   `wrapido help <namespace> <route> [<verb>] --format=json` — structured schema (args, types, enums), scoped to the verb's HTTP method.
-   `--format=json` prints errors as JSON.
-   `help ... --format=json` includes each endpoint's `required` arg names and the route's nested `children`.
-   `--fields=id,_embedded` also asks WordPress for `_links` (needed for `--_embed` to work).
-   `list --format=count` prints the site total (from `X-WP-Total`); when more pages exist, stderr says `Page 1 of N (T total)`.
-   `list --per_page=-1` returns every page at once, requesting the route's maximum page size each time; if the route's schema doesn't declare both `page` and `per_page` (often because it declares no args at all), `-1` is instead forwarded to the API literally, with a notice on stderr.
-   An unknown route exits `1` with `No such route`, and a bare unknown namespace with `No such namespace` (in agent mode this also applies when a verb is given).
-   `--fields=id,title.rendered` keeps nesting in JSON/YAML.
-   `types`, `taxonomies` and `statuses` list one row per entry.

## Authentication for agents

`auth ... login` prints a URL and waits for a callback on `127.0.0.1`, so a person has to open it in a browser on the same machine. Headless options:

-   `WP_USERNAME` + `WP_PASSWORD` environment variables (a WordPress [Application Password](authentication-application-passwords.md)) — preferred, since `--password` leaks into shell history and the process list.
-   Store once with `wrapido auth application-passwords add <url> --username="$WP_USERNAME" --password="$WP_PASSWORD"`.
-   [OAuth2](authentication-oauth2.md), on a site running the WP-API/OAuth2 plugin: `wrapido auth oauth2 add <url> --client-id=<id> --client-secret=<secret>` (`client_credentials`), or `wrapido auth oauth2 add <url> --token=<token>` for a personal access token.

Stored credentials are used implicitly for that site; `wrapido auth <type> list` prints them as JSON. Use `--use-auth=none` to see what an anonymous visitor sees. An OAuth2 `client_credentials` token acts as user 0, so drafts and `--context=edit` still need a real user.

## Recommended setup

Put a `wrapido.yml` next to the agent's working directory so it never has to repeat the site:

```yaml
url: https://example.com
```

and export `WRAPIDO_AGENT=1` in the agent's environment. Point the agent at [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/spacedmonkey/wrapido/blob/main/AGENTS.md), which is written for it.
