# Usage

## Command grammar

The whole CLI is one dynamic grammar built from whatever routes a site's REST API actually registers — there's no fixed command tree to memorize:

```text
wrapido                                                         # discover: list namespaces from the site's REST API index
wrapido <namespace>                                             # list routes registered under that namespace
wrapido <namespace> <route>                                     # introspect: show the route's supported methods/args/context (an OPTIONS request)
wrapido <namespace> <route> list        [--page=] [--per_page=] [...]   # --per_page=-1: every page
wrapido <namespace> <route> get <id>...
wrapido <namespace> <route> create      [--field=value...] [--body=<json>]
wrapido <namespace> <route> update <id>... [--field=value...] [--body=<json>]
wrapido <namespace> <route> delete <id>... [--force]
wrapido <namespace> <route> exists <id>
wrapido <namespace> <route> generate    [--count=<n>] [--field=value...]
wrapido <namespace> <route> meta <add|clean-duplicates|delete|get|list|patch|pluck|update> ...
wrapido help [<namespace> [<route...> [<verb>]]]                # same shapes, but never performs the request
wrapido config get|set|clear
```

-   `list`/`create`/`generate` don't take an `<id>` — everything after the verb is treated as `field=value` pairs.
-   `get`/`update`/`delete`/`exists` require an `<id>` as the first token after the verb. `get`/`update`/`delete` take **one or more** ids (`<id>...`, like WP-CLI's `wp post delete 1 2 3`): every token before the first `field=value` is an id, and `update` applies the same fields to each. `exists` takes exactly one.
-   With several ids, each id gets its own result: one `Success: Deleted posts 12.` line per id in table format, or an array in any other format (`get 12` still returns a single object). A failed id prints `<id>: Error: ...` on stderr and makes the command exit `1`; the other ids are still reported. See [Batch requests](#batch-requests).
-   `exists` reuses `get`'s request shape but reports success/failure instead of printing the resource: exit code `0` if the id exists, `1` if it doesn't (a `404`).
-   Any failure — a bad flag, a live API error, a network problem — prints `Error: ...` (or, under `--format=json`/[agent mode](agent-mode.md), a JSON `{"error":{...}}` object) to **stderr** and exits `1`; stdout is left untouched. Success exits `0`.
-   `generate` isn't a single HTTP request — it creates `--count` items, reusing the same fields for each item (batched where the site allows, see [Batch requests](#batch-requests)).
-   A route registered under nested literal path segments (e.g. a theme's `global-styles/themes/(?P<stylesheet>%s)`) is addressed as separate words, the same way WP-CLI addresses nested commands — e.g. `wrapido wp/v2 global-styles themes get <stylesheet>`.

```

## Routing

Most routes are a single segment with the parameter, if any, at the end (`posts get <id>`) — but the REST API registers some routes that don't fit that shape, and the CLI addresses all of them the same way it addresses a plain route: as words after the namespace.

**Mid-path parameters.** A route's placeholder isn't always at the end of its path — e.g. core's own `posts/(?P<parent>[\d]+)/revisions`. The CLI still finds it (`splitPlaceholder`/`paramIndex` in `core/indexer.ts`) and splices the id into the right spot instead of always appending it:

```sh
wrapido wp/v2 posts revisions get <parent-post-id>
```

A route with **two or more** placeholders (e.g. one specific revision of one specific post) needs values for all of them, typed in order after the route's own words — this only reaches plain introspection/`get`, since the CLI's grammar has just one `<id>` slot for every other verb.

**Hybrid routes.** A route can be both directly addressable *and* a container for further nested routes at once — e.g. `global-styles/themes` becomes hybrid once a `variations` child is registered beneath it. Introspecting a hybrid route shows its own schema plus a note listing the nested children, rather than one or the other. See [Help](help.md#listing-children) for how this renders.

**`types`/`taxonomies`/`statuses` are keyed, not paged.** These three routes return an object keyed by slug (`{post: {...}, page: {...}}`), not an array. `list` unpacks that into one row per entry via `Object.values(...)`, so `--fields`/`--format=ids`/etc. all still work — but they're never fetch-all candidates the way a normal paginated collection is; see [Pagination](pagination.md#preconditions).

**`create` follows its `Location` header.** A successful `create` returns whatever the `201` response's `Location` header points at (fetched with your `--context`), not the raw `POST` body — so the printed/returned resource is the canonical one, same-origin only.

**`generate` synthesizes missing fields.** `generate --count=<n>` loops `create` `n` times. Any field the route's schema marks `required` that you didn't supply gets an auto-generated value rather than failing outright; a couple of known-tricky endpoints (e.g. a required-but-hidden field WordPress itself doesn't declare, or `wp/v2/widgets`' `id_base`, discovered live from the sibling `widget-types` route) have extra recovery logic on top of the generic synthesis.

**Discovering a site's REST API root.** Given just `--url=<site>`, the CLI tries, in order, until one works: a `HEAD` request's `Link: <...>; rel="https://api.w.org/"` header, then the same on a `GET`, then an HTML `<link rel="https://api.w.org/">` tag in the page, then the conventional `/wp-json/` path, then `/?rest_route=/` (for sites without pretty permalinks). `--debug` logs which attempt succeeded.

## Batch requests

WordPress 5.6+ has a batch endpoint, `POST /batch/v1`, that runs many write requests in one HTTP round-trip. wrapido uses it automatically for `generate --count=<n>` and for `update`/`delete` with several ids, when the site allows it. Otherwise it sends one request per item, with the same output either way.

Everything is read from the site's own REST index. No limits are hardcoded:

-   **Is there a batch endpoint?** It needs a `/batch/v1` route. WordPress 5.5 and older has none, and a plugin can remove it.
-   **How many requests per batch?** That's the route's `requests.maxItems`, 25 by default (WordPress's `rest_get_max_batch_size` filter).
-   **Which methods?** That's the route's method enum, `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` in stock WordPress, so `get` is only batched on a site that adds `GET`.
-   **Does this route allow it?** The route's endpoint for that method must say `allow_batch: {"v1": true}`. WordPress shows this in the index from 5.9. Core posts, pages, custom post types, terms, menus, widgets and (from 6.6) users opt in. Media, comments, settings and global styles don't.

For example, to delete every draft post, feed the ids from `list` straight into `delete`. `--per_page=-1` fetches every page, `--format=ids` prints just the ids separated by spaces, and `--quiet` keeps notes out of the output:

```sh
wrapido --url=https://example.com wp/v2 posts delete $(wrapido --url=https://example.com wp/v2 posts list \
  --per_page=-1 --fields=id --format=ids --status=draft --quiet)
```

Without `--force`, deleted posts go to the trash; add `--force` to delete them permanently. Running from a clone with `npm run`? Use `npm run -s wrapido -- …` for the inner command, or npm's banner ends up among the ids.

`generate` always sends its first item on its own, so a missing required field fails fast with the usual error. The rest go in batches of `maxItems`, one batch at a time: 200 posts take 9 requests instead of 200. `--debug` logs why batching wasn't used for a run, and each batched item's status.

**When a batch fails.** wrapido always prints the real cause (the HTTP status, plus WordPress's error code and message or the text of an HTML error page) and says what happened to each item:

| What happened | What wrapido does | Exit |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The site refused the batch before running anything (a firewall's 403, a 404, a 413 "too large") | `Warning: Batch request failed (...); sending the remaining N items individually.` Batching stays off for the rest of the run. | `0` if every item then succeeds |
| An item inside a batch failed | `#14: Error: ...` (or `<id>: Error: ...`). The rest of that batch already ran and is reported. Later items are listed as `Not sent:`. | `1` |
| The outcome is unknown: a timeout, a 5xx, or a response that isn't JSON | `Batch request for #27–#51 failed.` with a hint that those items may or may not exist. **Nothing is resent**, since WordPress usually finishes a batch even after a proxy gives up, and resending would create duplicates. | `1` |

In every case stdout still lists every item that **was** created, updated or deleted, so you can see what exists. This changed `generate`: it used to stop at the first failure without printing the items it had already created.

A batch request gets 110 seconds (under Cloudflare's 125-second limit) rather than the usual 20; `--timeout` overrides both.

**Error hints.** A local `CliError` or a live `WpApiError` prints a one-line `Error: ...`, and common REST error codes (`rest_forbidden`, `rest_no_route`, `rest_forbidden_context`, `rest_post_invalid_id`, `rest_invalid_param`, the `rest_upload_*` family, any `rest_cannot_*` code) get a human-readable hint appended beneath it — a hint can also be set per-error by the code that raised it (used by `generate`'s recovery path to explain exactly why a field couldn't be synthesized).

**Ctrl-C during a progress bar.** Interrupting a `list --per_page=-1`, `generate`, or upload mid-flight (a progress bar or spinner is on screen) stops it cleanly and exits with code `130`, instead of leaving the terminal's line-wrapping disabled.

| `--truncate-length=<n>`                               | —              | Max characters a table cell shows before truncating; default 50. `0` shows full values. Per-invocation only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `--quiet`                                             | `quiet`        | Suppress spinners, progress bars and notes, plus Node's own process warnings (e.g. `ExperimentalWarning: Importing JSON modules ...` on older Node 20/22 releases). Errors and warnings about your command still print.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `--debug`                                             | `debug`        | Print a stack trace on unexpected (non-API) errors, and log every HTTP request/response to stderr plus the config files loaded and which site-discovery attempt succeeded (see [Routing](#routing)). Redacted before logging: the `Authorization`/cookie/`x-wp-nonce`/`x-api-key` headers, and `password`/`client_secret`/`code`/`access_token`/`refresh_token` body fields. API requests add `?_envelope=true` so WordPress returns its response headers (`X-WP-Total`, plugin headers such as Query Monitor's `X-QM-*`, ...), which are logged too; the body is unwrapped and output is unchanged. |
| `-h`, `--help`                                        | —              | Show help for the given namespace/route/verb, or the top-level help.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Flags with a YAML key can be set in a [config file](configuration.md#yaml-config-files); a flag on the command line always wins.

Any other `--name=value` (or bare `--name`, treated as `--name=true`) is passed straight through as a WordPress REST API field or query argument — e.g. `--per_page=5`, `--title="Hello"`, `--force`. Run `wrapido <namespace> <route>` first to see exactly which ones a route accepts.

`list --per_page=-1` fetches **every** page — see [Pagination](pagination.md) for the full algorithm (parallel batching, the `Link`-header fallback, `--format=count`'s shortcut, and which routes it doesn't apply to).

## Agent mode

Auto-detected inside Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot's agent tooling, Cline and Cursor (or set `WRAPIDO_AGENT=1` by hand): plain, machine-friendly output (JSON by default, no colour or spinners, JSON errors, unknown-flag warnings) without changing anything for interactive use. See [Agent mode](agent-mode.md).

## Paging

Any command's output pages through `less` (or `$PAGER`) automatically at a real terminal — see [Paging output](configuration.md#paging-output).

## TLS certificates

The CLI does **not** verify HTTPS certificates, so sites with self-signed, expired or mismatched certificates (local and staging installs) work without extra flags. This applies to every request, including uploads and downloads. Because the server's identity isn't checked, avoid using it with real credentials over untrusted networks.

## Help

`wrapido help [<namespace> [<route...> [<verb>]]]` renders the same usage synopsis you'd see interactively, built dynamically from the site's live introspected schema, but never performs the underlying request. See [Help](help.md) for the full page, including the WP-CLI-style `--help` output.

## Uploading files

Mark a value with `@` to upload it, using the parameter name the endpoint expects: `wrapido wp/v2 media create --file=./cat.jpg`. See [Uploading files](uploading-files.md).
