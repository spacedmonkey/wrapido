## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

This CLI handles WordPress credentials and Application Passwords, so if you believe you've found a
security issue - anything from credential handling/logging, to auth bypass, to unsafe handling of
untrusted REST API responses - please report it privately through
[GitHub private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/spacedmonkey/wrapido/security/advisories/new).

Please include as much detail as you can: the command/flow that triggers the issue, the version of
`wrapido` and Node.js you're using, and, if possible, steps to reproduce. We'll aim to acknowledge
reports promptly and keep you updated as the issue is investigated and fixed.
